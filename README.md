### Description:
"DiscoSheep" makes sheep iterate through all the dye colors when they are damaged by players. The plugin allows you to change how fast the colors iterate, how much damage is done to the sheep, if you want the sheep to glow when damaged, and if you want the sheep to fly up in the air when damaged.
